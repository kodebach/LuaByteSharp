# LuaByteSharp

This is a Lua byte code interpreter written in C#.

It was created for the [Abstrakte Maschinen (German)](http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/andi/185.966.html) course at [TU Wien](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/).
That is why some of the files describing the project are written in German.
